<h1>Accessibility tests</h1>

<p class="lead">
  Each accessibility test is either a simple selector or a complex JavaScript callback which checks document structure and content clarity. Below is a list of all tests and their related documentation.
</p>
<p>
Tests are entirely optional, they are turned on and off by using a <a href="/guidelines">default guideline</a>, or you can build your own guideline with as many tests as you wish.
